# Account Mapping Contracts

TinyGo WASM smart contracts that bridge account-based blockchains (EVM and ERC-20 compatible) to the VSC/Magi network.

Companion to [vsc-eco/utxo-mapping](https://github.com/vsc-eco/utxo-mapping), which covers UTXO-based chains (BTC, LTC, DASH, DOGE, BCH).

## Supported Chains

| Contract | Chain(s) | Asset |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `evm-mapping-contract` | Ethereum + any EVM L2 (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, …) | ETH + ERC-20 |

Chain selection is compile-time via the `NetworkMode` ldflag and runtime via `setChainId`.

## How It Works

The contract verifies on-chain deposit proofs (receipt-trie inclusion against a stored block header) and credits the depositor's VSC account with a wrapped token balance. Withdrawals (unmapping) construct and TSS-sign an EVM transaction, returning funds to the user's external address.

## Contract Actions

**Deposit & transfer:**
- `map` — process an incoming deposit with a receipt-trie proof
- `transfer` / `transferFrom` / `approve` / `increaseAllowance` / `decreaseAllowance` — ERC-20-style balance operations on mapped tokens
- `confirmSpend` — finalize a pending unmap after its tx confirms on-chain

**Withdrawal:**
- `unmapETH` — withdraw native ETH to an external address
- `unmapERC20` — withdraw a registered ERC-20 token
- `unmapFrom` — withdraw on behalf of a third party via allowance
- `replaceWithdrawal` — replace a stuck withdrawal tx (e.g. for fee bump)
- `clearNonce` — reset the contract's EVM nonce tracker after an on-chain rollback

**Chain relay:**
- `addBlocks` — oracle appends new EVM block headers
- `replaceBlock` — replace the tip header after a reorg

**Admin / owner:**
- `registerPublicKey` — register TSS primary + backup keys
- `registerRouter` — register the DEX router contract
- `registerToken` — whitelist an ERC-20 contract
- `setVault` — set the 20-byte EVM vault address holding mapped funds
- `setChainId` — set the EIP-155 chain ID
- `setGasReserve` — set the gas buffer retained for withdrawal txs
- `adminMint` — emergency mint (owner-only)

## Build

```bash
cd evm-mapping-contract
USE_DOCKER=1 make testnet   # -> bin/testnet.wasm
USE_DOCKER=1 make mainnet   # -> bin/mainnet.wasm
USE_DOCKER=1 make dev       # -> bin/dev.wasm (regtest)
make test                   # Go tests (no TinyGo)
```

Docker is recommended because TinyGo 0.39 requires Go 1.19–1.25 and most dev boxes run newer Go.
