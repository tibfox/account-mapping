// Supply tracks per-asset solvency totals. The three monetary accumulators
// are *big.Int (full wei / token-native precision, no overflow). BaseFee is
// a per-gas price observation (wei/gas) and stays a uint64 scalar.
//
// Semantics (canonical, per product spec):
//
//   - Active — total custody: the exact amount of the asset the bridge
//     believes it holds (for "eth", the L1 vault balance including the gas
//     reserve). This is the maximum theoretical spend. L1 gas paid to
//     mainnet miners LEAVES custody and is debited from Active; it is
//     never parked in Fee. Exact up to gas-ESTIMATE variance: unmaps debit
//     the upper-bound estimate (gasUnits × gasFeeCap), so Active may
//     slightly UNDERSTATE real custody — the safe direction for solvency.
//
//   - User — the portion of Active attributed to Magi-network accounts
//     (Σ of all ledger balances; smart contracts count as users).
//
//   - Fee — Magi-internal revenue fees ONLY (e.g. a percentage of unmaps).
//     No such fee exists today, so Fee stays 0. L1 gas and the gas-reserve
//     deposit tax are NOT Magi fees and never land here.
//
// The ETH gas reserve (GasReserveKey) is custody that is neither user- nor
// fee-attributed, so for "eth": Active == User + Fee + gasReserve. For
// ERC-20 assets there is no reserve component: Active == User + Fee.
