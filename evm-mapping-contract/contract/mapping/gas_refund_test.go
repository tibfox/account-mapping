// Gas-reserve correction semantics (supersedes the original EVM-C4 test).
//
// EVM-C4 originally made HandleConfirmSpend's failure branch refund the gas
// reserve on a reverted receipt. That was backwards: a status=0 receipt
// means the tx MINED, so the L1 gas WAS paid to the miner — refunding the
// reserve counter overstated it vs the real vault balance. The corrected
// rule matches reality:
//
//   - reverted receipt (gas paid)      → reserve NOT refunded
//   - proven-dropped tx (nothing paid) → reserve restored, user made whole
//
// EVM-C4's liveness concern (reserve exhaustion blocking withdrawals) is
// preserved: the deposit tax keeps funding the reserve, and dropped-tx
// restores now work via refundDroppedWithdrawal.

// TestGasReserve_DroppedWithdrawalRestoresReserve — an ERC-20 PendingSpend
// proven dropped restores both the reserve counter and the Active("eth")
// custody booking, and refunds the user's tokens.
